This GitHub repo was initially set up for my master thesis. 

iden_ransomware.py allows you to lookup the hash filename of an unclassified folder of ransomware samples with the VirusTotal database. It will change the filename to the ransomware family as labelled by Microsoft + a counter.

The image_conversion folders convert the labelled files to grayscale images. The 1-step conversion does not save the full resolution images, whereas as the 2-step conversion does.
