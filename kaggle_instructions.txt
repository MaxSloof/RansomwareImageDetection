1. First, make sure the 'thesis-data' AND 'checkpoint' data (for the DCGAN-classification or DCGAN) is added to the notebook before you run the model. 
2. Write down all the specific elements of this model at the top of the notebook

3. When you commit the model, you need to save and run -> advanced settings -> 'always save all output'. 
4. Always use the GitHub repo as reference to the latest files. Textual changes might have been made to the Kaggle notebooks in the GitHub repo. 

5. After the model is done in Kaggle, run the model script to the pull the notebook and the output files. Beware that it might not download all files from a given output/working folder. E.g. number of images that it pulls stops at epoch 49. You should still be able to download the output for every version of a notebook later.
